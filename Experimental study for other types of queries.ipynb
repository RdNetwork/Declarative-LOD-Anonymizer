    "In the case of a workload consisting exclusively in star queries, the first graph is not relevant since every execution of the algorithm featuring policies with an overlapping measure over 0% results in an incompatible case. Compatible cases are then exclusively without any overlapping, which makes such a graph (candidate sets length over overlapping measure) irrelevant. We also note that the trend of incompatibility measurements is quite different than in the previous cases.\n",

    "This happens because of the particular structure of star queries. We think that our notion of overlapping tends to be quite strict for this class of queries, since we work with edge-based overlapping.

This suggests another alternative for defining overlapping, a node-centered definition. \n",

    "\n",
    "We can observe than the trend of results in the case of chain queries, as well as a mix of star and star/chain queries is similar to what we previously observed in the case of star/chain queries ((a) compatibility rising when privacy size increases and decreasing when utility size increases; (b) quick decrease of candidate sets length when overlapping increases; (c) candidate sets length growing steadily when privacy size increases and stagnating or slowly decreasing when utility size increases). Otherwise, star queries provides slightly different results - if not similar, and presents an interesting problem of interest for the notion of overlapping that we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also note that using a simpler prototype, offering less operations to add to anonymizing sequences, does not change the trend of our results, but obviously provide way less anonymization alternatives.\n"
