    "It has been brought in various reviews of our submission that the experimental study we carried out covered only chain queries, bypassing other types such as star queries. We did not cover them for the sake of simplicity, but we acknowledge the need for results in these cases and we present these experiments here.\n",

    "The technical context and the background for this new set of experiments is the same as in the submission: we run the experiments in the exact same conditions, on a workload of 500 random queries generated using gMark. We generate three separate workloads: one featuring **only star/chain queries**, the second with **a random mix of star/chain and star queries** , and the last one featuring **only star queries**.\n",
