    "The technical context and the background for this new set of experiments is the same as in the submission: we run the experiments in the exact same conditions, on a workload of 500 random queries generated using gMark. We generate three separate workloads: one featuring **only star/chain queries**, the second with **a random mix of star/chain and star queries**, and the last one featuring **only star queries**.\n",

    "In the case of a workload consisting exclusively in star queries, the first graph is not relevant since every execution of the algorithm featuring policies with an overlapping measure over 0% results in an incompatible case. Compatible cases are then exclusively without any overlapping, which makes such a graph (candidate sets length over overlapping measure) irrelevant. We also note that the trend of incompatibility measurements is quite different than in the previous cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because of the particular structure of star queries. We think that our notion of overlapping tends to be quite strict for this class of queries, since we work with edge-based overlapping. Such a kind of overlapping is problematic when it happens with star queries, since the center of star is always involved and blocks possible deletions. This suggests another alternative for defining overlapping, a node-centered definition. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe than the trend of results in the case of star/chain queries as well as a mix of star and star/chain queries is similar to what we previously observed in the case of chain queries ((a) compatibility rising when privacy size increases and decreasing when utility size increases; (b) quick decrease of candidate sets length when overlapping increases; (c) candidate sets length growing steadily when privacy size increases and stagnating or slowly decreasing when utility size increases).    Otherwise, star queries provides slightly different results - if not similar, and presents an interesting problem of interest for the notion of overlapping that we use.\n"
